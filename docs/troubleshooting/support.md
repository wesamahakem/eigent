Eigent offers flexible plans for every type of user, from individuals to large enterprises. Our services are divided into two main categories: Cloud and Self-Hosted.

### Cloud Service

Our Cloud Service is a subscription-based offering that gives you access to Eigent's powerful AI models and infrastructure without any setup.

- **Free:** Perfect for getting started. Includes **500 Credits** per month.

### Self-Hosted Service

For users who require more control, privacy, and customization, we offer self-hosted solutions. To view more open-source information, please visit [GitHub](https://github.com/eigent-ai/eigent).

- **Free:** Designed for individual users, open-source developers, small teams, or non-commercial projects. This plan requires you to host your own models and provide your own API keys. 

- **Scalable:** Ideal for teams requiring enhanced reliability and support. This plan also allows for  logo and brand customization.

- **Custom:** A bespoke solution for enterprise clients with specific needs for features, support, security and control.

## Credits & Billing

### How Credits work?

- 1 USD = 100 Credits for top‑ups.
- Credits are the currency you use to power your tasks in Eigent's Cloud Service. Every action that uses our cloud service consumes Credits.

### Free Credits and Trials

- New sign‑ups get **1000** bonus Credits.
- To reward active users, we grant **200** Credits every day you use the app. Unused amounts don’t roll over to the next day.
- All paid subscription plans (Plus and Pro) come with a **7-day free trial**. You can cancel anytime within this period at no charge.

### **Upgrading or Topping‑up**

- Click **User** icon in the Eigent webpage.
- Click **Account Settings** to open your personal account page.
- Click **Upgrade** to move to a higher tier with more monthly Credits.
- Click **+ Add Credits** to purchase an Add-On Pack when you've used up your monthly allowance.

### Invitation Code

Just below your plan card you’ll see your exclusive invitation code. Share it with a friend! Both of you automatically receive **500 Credits** once they register.

### Credits Usage

Scroll to credits usage dashboard to view:

- **Total Credits**: Your current available balance.
- **Daily Refreshed Credits:** Your 200‑Credit daily bonus countdown. These daily credits are used first before your main balance is touched.
- **Credits History:** This is a log of all transactions on your account. You can see how Credits were added (e.g., `monthly`, `invite`, `register`) and how they were spent (`consume`).


**Note on Balance**

Your balance is calculated based on the total credits added minus the total consumed within your current billing cycle.

If your balance becomes negative, it will be displayed as **0**. This means your service may be restricted until new Credits are added to your account.

### Billing Cycle and Cancellations

- For free users, your monthly cycle starts on the date you registered. For subscribers, it starts on the date of your first successful subscription.
- Daily active credits are used first (no rollover), followed by monthly pack credits (no rollover to next month), and finally, top-up pack credits (which don't expire).
- You can cancel any subscription or Add-On Pack purchase within 7 days for a full refund.
    - Plan resets to Free and billing cycle resets to registration date.
    - Credits balance re‑computed according to Free‑tier rules.
- How do I cancel my subscription? Please contact **infot@eigent.ai.**
- You can download invoices from the payment confirmation email sent to your registered email address.
